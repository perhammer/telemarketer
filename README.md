# Telemarketer

Sick of getting nuisance calls? Problem not solved by apps like TrueCaller ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/truecaller-number-search-spam/id448142450)) (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.truecaller&hl=en_GB Android), or just fancy taking a more organic, hands-on approach to blocking calls? Now you can!

## Instructions
### Set Up
To get started with blocking nuisance calls,follow these steps to add the Telemarketer ☠ contact to your phone:
1. [Visit this link][https://cdn.rawgit.com/perhammer/telemarketer/189c12c9/Telemarketer%20%E2%98%A0..vcf] on your phone and add it to your contacts
2. 
  * On *iOS*:
  ** Go to Settings > Phone > Call Blocking & Identification and mark Telemarketer ☠ as blocked.
  ** More details from [Apple's knowledge-base][https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201229]
  * On *Android*:
  ** Consult this article on [Android Authority][https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201229]
3. Done! My list of 60 or so (at the time of writing) nuisance callers is now blocked on your phone.

### Adding numbers to block
If you receive a nuisance call and want to block them, the easiest way is to *add* the number to the existing Telemarketer ☠ contact:
1.
  * on *iOS*:
  ** In "Recent Calls", tap the 'i' icon next to the number that called you, and select '*Add to Existing Contact*', and then select Telemarketer ☠
  * On *Android*:
  ** From the call log (in the Phone or Dialer app), tap the number that called you, and select '*Add to Contacts*', and then select Telemarketer ☠
2. Done! The nuisance number is now blocked!

### Sharing your blocked numbers (optional)
If you want to share your blocked numbers with me (and whoever else downloads this contact), that's easy:
1. On *iOS*:
  ** In 'Contacts', select the Telemarketer ☠ entry and tap 'Share Contact' at the bottom of the screen. Select *email* and send it to *telemarketer (at) perhammer.com* and I'll merge your changes with mine.
2. On *Android*:
  ** In 'Contacts', do a long press on the Telemarketer ☠ entry and tap 'Send namecard via' from the menu. Select *email* and send it to *telemarketer (at) perhammer.com* and I'll merge your changes with mine.
3. On *GitHub*:
  ** If you want to send me a pull-request:
  *** Clone this repo
  *** Follow all the above instructions to email your Telemarketer ☠ entry to *yourself*
  *** Merge your .vcf into your repo
  *** Send me a pull-request :)

## Disclaimers And Acknowledgements
All the numbers stored in my Telemarketer ☠ contact were nuisance callers as identified by services like [who-called.co.uk] and [whocallsme.com] at the they called me. If you strongly believe a number has been added in error, or is no-longer originating nuisance calls, please contact me at *notatelemarketer (at) perhammer.com* and I'll consider removing from the shared contact.
